# MachineLearning
This repo contains code to train a single layer neural network to recognize handwritten digits.

I have used the MNIST dataset to train the network. MNIST dataset contains the images of handwritten digits in a greyscale format. Each image is 28*28  pixels.
My neural neywork consists of 785 input units(28*28) plus one for bias, and 10 output units(each for 0 - 9). There is one hidden layer.

part3 file contains code for dividing the training data into two parts.
train_part3 contains code for training the data.
plotData is a general file that plots the data for all 3 experiments.

Experiment 1:
Vary number of hidden units.

Experiment 2: 
Vary the momentum value.

Experiment 3: 
Vary the number of training examples.
